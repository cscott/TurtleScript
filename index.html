<div class="section" id="project-goals">
<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<p>The TurtleScript experiment attempts to provide a simple logo-like
programming environment which is based on a &quot;real&quot; programming
language.  It draws heavy inspiration from <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Etoys">Etoys</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/">Snap</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140127205214/http://www.chirp.scratchr.org/blog/?p=24">Elements</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://tinlizzie.org/jstile/">TileScript</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Turtle_Art">Turtle Art</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823011046/http://education.mit.edu/openblocks">Open Blocks</a>.  As a
browser-based programming environment, it builds on ideas from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.lively-kernel.org/index.html">Lively Kernel</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://lively.cs.tut.fi/qt/">Lively Qt</a>.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://tinlizzie.org/jstile/#TileScript">TileScript paper</a> describes
our own motivations well, although we've chosen a slightly different
path.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to construct a <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar">Sugar</a>-like activity environment with
a pervasive and scalable <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/View_Source">View Source</a> capability.  Any visible item
can be interrogated and almost all source code viewed, modified,
and saved for later use in an interactive fashion.  The choice of
JavaScript is intended to leverage modern browser technology, which
already provides an advanced runtime environment and sandbox.  It is
also a commercially-important programming language, which is (sadly)
important to many vocationally-minded educators.</p>
<p>I've also been recently (re)inspired by the Smalltalk community, and
in particular by Ian Piumarta's work on the small self-describing
systems <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612023705/http://piumarta.com/software/cola/">cola</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190207024931/http://piumarta.com/software/maru/">maru</a>.  The SELF bytecode format described in
Chambers et al's <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807083351/http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/implementation.html">OOPSLA 89</a> paper was a further incentive to
investigate minimal executable representations.  The hope is that
a few powerful optimizations can be employed against a tiny set of
fundamental operations to create a compact and high-performance
environment which is truly &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">turtles all the way down</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>I dusted off this project and wrote TurtleScript interpreters for
PHP (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/cscott/php-turtle">http://github.com/cscott/php-turtle</a>) and
Lua (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/cscott/lua-turtle">http://github.com/cscott/lua-turtle</a>).  I also added a new
<tt class="docutils literal">push_local_frame</tt> bytecode operation to allow &quot;register allocation&quot;
of local variables which do not escape their scope, and improved
the standard library implementation.</p>
<p>I expect to use these runtimes to explore two (interrelated) projects:
<a class="reference external" href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T230665">Multilingual JavaScript</a> and the use of JavaScript within
the MediaWiki <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto">Scribunto</a> extension.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a &quot;native&quot; interpreter for TurtleScript in Mozilla's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> programming language.  The source code
for that project can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/cscott/rusty-turtle">http://github.com/cscott/rusty-turtle</a>.</p>
<p>In the process I improved the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> for TurtleScript, built out the
standard library a bit, fixed bugs, and added <a class="reference external" href="http://nodejs.org">node</a> compatibility
and a test suite.</p>
<p>More recently I've begun to think about a
TurtleScript-to-<a class="reference external" href="http://asmjs.org">asm.js</a>-to-<a class="reference external" href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>
compiler, which would let me investigate object layout and performance
optimizations without resorting to Rust, C, or another low-level
language.  (Unfortunately <tt class="docutils literal">asm.js</tt> is not a proper subset of
TurtleScript at present, since TurtleScript doesn't have the <tt class="docutils literal">switch</tt>
statements or bitwise operators.  This gap can be mended.)
Accordingly, <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/asm-llvm.html">asm-llvm.js</a> is the beginnings of an <tt class="docutils literal">asm.js</tt>-to-LLVM
compiler, written in TurtleScript.</p>
<p>I've used this codebase to write an <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/asmjs.html">asm.js verification service</a>.
There's also a set of parser speed <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/benchmark/">benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p>The source code for the project is hosted at
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/cscott/TurtleScript">http://github.com/cscott/TurtleScript</a>.</p>
<p>It begins with a parser for the &quot;Simplified JavaScript&quot; of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/">Douglas Crockford</a> in <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/parse.html">parse.js</a>.  I've extended the language very
slightly: it now supports block comments and '$' in identifiers, and
represents blocks in the parse tree in a more uniform fashion.  I've
also hoisted all variable declarations to the top of a block, to more
accurately reflect their scope.  Some further improvements are
discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#interesting-parser-tasks">Interesting Parser Tasks</a>, but the base language is not
expected to change much more.</p>

<p class="caption">Simple bytecode compiler/interpreter, 2011</p>
</div>
<p>There are a few backends which process the parsed text.  The first to
be implemented (<a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/jcompile.html">jcompile.js</a>, July 2010) simply emitted JavaScript
from the parse tree which can be <tt class="docutils literal">eval</tt>'ed by the browser's standard
JavaScript environment.  At the moment, this isn't very interesting—but it allows us to modify the parsed language in various ways
and still emit ECMA-standard JavaScript which can take advantage of
browsers' highly-tuned JavaScript implementations.  Some possible
extensions are described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#interesting-compiler-tasks">Interesting Compiler Tasks</a> section.</p>
<p>In May 2011 I wrote a simple bytecode compiler/interpreter for the
language, inspired by Piumarta's <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190207024931/http://piumarta.com/software/maru/">maru</a> system.  You can test the
parser and the bytecode compiler and interpreter using <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/tdop.html">tdop.html</a>,
which is a highly modified version of Douglas Crockford's original <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905114538/http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/index.html">parser
demonstration</a>.  The bytecode instruction set is simple, but not
simple enough; <a class="reference internal" href="#simplifying-the-environment">Simplifying the Environment</a> discusses improvements.</p>

<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/tile2.html"><img alt="2010 graphical tiles" src="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/images/tiles1.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">Original CSS experiments, 2010</p>
</div>
<p>Back in 2010 I implemented some simple tile-based renderers for the parse
tree.  These used <a class="reference external" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to render the tree as CSS-styled HTML.
A CSS-styling demo is at <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/tile2.html">tile2.html</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/tiles.html">tiles.html</a> displays
&quot;editable&quot; interactive source using <a class="reference external" href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>.  I was dissatisfied
with these results.  The markup process was very slow, and rendering
into HTML/CSS added a lot of additional difficulty and complexity.
The promise of clean semantic HTML for the program source was not
fulfilled: the actual generated HTML needed to be exceedingly crufty
in order to get the rendering close to what I wanted.  The interaction
model also failed to satisfy: jQuery UI had a lot of problems with
horizontal layouts, and the real time re-layout during drag operations
made the display stutter unacceptably.</p>
<div class="figure align-right">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/ctiles.html"><img alt="2011 graphical tiles" src="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/images/tiles2.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">Tile Rendering using &lt;canvas&gt;, 2011</p>
</div>
<p>I revisited the rendering code in 2011.  As discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#rendering-ideas">Rendering
Ideas</a> section, I wanted to explore tile-based representations that
were nonetheless faithful to the &quot;traditional&quot; text-based layout of
source.  This time I decided to skip the complexity of the HTML/CSS
layers and render directly to a canvas.  The result can be seen at
<a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/ctiles.html">ctiles.html</a>.  This renderer is written in Simplified JavaScript
with a very small <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/ccanvas.html">canvas API</a>, and can display itself.
Further discussion can be found in the <a class="reference internal" href="#interaction-ideas">Interaction Ideas</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#renderer-tasks">Renderer Tasks</a> sections.</p>
<p>It is my intention to drive towards an initial application similar to
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Turtle_Art">Turtle Art</a>, with an on-screen turtle controlled by the script tiles.
This will be a public demonstration of the ideas behind the
TurtleScript project.  The on-screen palette will include a tab for
each imported namespace, which displays tiles for each name
(method or variable) defined in that namespace.  So the activity would
initially offer a <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> method to be defined, starting with
<tt class="docutils literal">var turtle = imports.turtle</tt> (borrowing the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110726160607/http://cananian.livejournal.com/58744.html">gjs module system</a>,
which is built on the single global <tt class="docutils literal">imports</tt> definition).  This is
sufficient to put the standard <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forward(...)</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">turn(...)</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">pen up()</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">pen down()</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">color(...)</span></tt> definitions on the first page of the
palette.  By dragging these into the <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> function, we can create
a simple turtle program.  There should be at least three other buttons
visible, to run/stop the turtle or clear the screen.</p>
<p>But you should also be able to open the <tt class="docutils literal">turtle</tt> namespace to look at
how the commands are defined (in Simplified JavaScript), and thus to add your
own turtle commands!  These will show up in the turtle palette like any
other commands.</p>
<p>Ideally you should also be able to drill down all the way to the parser,
compiler, and renderer, to effect even more fundamental changes to the
language driving the turtle.  In fact, you can keep digging all the
way into the object system and runtime.  Turtles all the way down!</p>

<div class="section" id="interesting-parser-tasks">
<h2>Interesting Parser Tasks</h2>
<p>There are a few different things one could do to extend the &quot;Simplified
JavaScript&quot; language.  The four that I think are interesting are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Transform variable names.</p>
<p>It would be better to present &quot;readable&quot; variable names, including
embedded spaces to separate words.  Typical underscore or
StudlyCaps conventions can be reversibly transformed to their
corresponding readable names in the parse tree, and converted back
in the compiler pass.  For example, &quot;make_parse&quot; in the source
becomes &quot;make parse&quot; in the parse tree, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Further, we'd like to avoid the requirement to reserve keywords from
use as variable names.  Since we'd like to localize the
keyword names in the future, we especially don't want to have to reserve
all possible keyword names in all possible languages.  Better would be
to use a standard convention to transform the names when parsing/compiling,
such that <tt class="docutils literal">$if</tt> in the source gets rendered as the plain name <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> in
the parse tree, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>We will also want to reserve some names for use by the compiler.
A reasonable solution is to transform names to protect (say) &quot;leading $&quot;
for the exclusive use of the compiler.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves from JavaScript implementations which don't support
full Unicode in identifiers, we might also want to transform names to
escape/unescape these characters.</p>
<p>Once the variable names are independent of the keywords, both
variable names and keywords ought to be fully translatable. A good
demo would be to translate a good chunk of the system code (and
comments!) and allow real-time switching between display languages.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Introduce a <a class="reference external" href="http://search.cpan.org/~tmtm/Yada-Yada-Yada-1.00/Yada.pm">yada yada yada</a> operator.</p>
<p>When programming interactively, we will often have some &quot;holes&quot; in the
program which haven't yet been filled in.  For instance, we might have
dragged a &quot;while&quot; tile in from a palette, but haven't yet filled in
the test expression or the contents of the loop block.</p>
<p>From Perl 6 we borrow the <tt class="docutils literal">...</tt> operator, pronounced &quot;yada yada yada&quot;.
This is used to represent a &quot;hole&quot; in the program which hasn't yet been
filled in.  By adding this to the formal syntax we simplify
serializing/compiling/viewing programs with holes.</p>
<p>The yada yada yada operator can be compiled to
<tt class="docutils literal">Object.yada_yada_yada()</tt> or some other placeholder or global method.
By default it will probably throw an exception or enter the debugger.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add an <tt class="docutils literal">imports</tt> global.</p>
<p>This is a trivial change to the top-level scope of the parser, but it
is the hook on which the module mechanism will hang.  The existing
code should be rewritten to use the imports global, which we'll
hand-populate with our modules until we've got a &quot;real&quot; loader
running.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Preserve comments and new lines.</p>
<p>Comments are an important part of the documentation of a program,
and shouldn't get discarded during the parse.  Similarly, newlines
are an important part of the formatting of the program text, which
is useful even when doing graphical rendering (see <a class="reference internal" href="#rendering-ideas">Rendering
Ideas</a>, below).  Newlines can be attached to parser tokens.  In
the simplest case, each token would have a boolean flag to indicate
whether it was followed by a newline.  I haven't yet figured out
whether a boolean is sufficient, or whether we actually need to
count <em>how many</em> newlines occur.  I assume we should count them all
initially, and chose the ignore the quantity at a later stage if
that turns out to be best.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast, I don't believe these are pressing (or even
desirable):</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Add throw, try, catch, and finally keywords.  Add delete and in operators.</p>
<p>Exceptions add a lot to the expressivity of the language.  I expect
that their function can be implemented in the library, however,
without requiring additional syntax in the base language.  The
<a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/extensions.html">extensions.js</a> file demonstrates how these might be implemented
as library methods.  The implementations of these methods will need
to be primitive (and thus will not be introspectable), but we can
retain our simplified syntactic vocabulary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add more/better looping constructs.</p>
<p>Simplified JavaScript only has a <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt> loop.  For beginning
programmers, a <tt class="docutils literal">for i = 1 to 5 { ... }</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">repeat(5) { ... }</tt>
sort of loop might be easier to understand.  A standard library
function (taking a function as a block) or a macro or &quot;build your
own tile&quot; feature might be a better way to add this feature.  (In
particular, I've found myself using the standard <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach">Arrays.forEach</a>
method extensively when writing Simplified JavaScript.)</p>

<div class="section" id="interesting-compiler-tasks">
<h2>Interesting Compiler Tasks</h2>
<p>Extending the compiler in ways which change the semantics of the
language must be done with care: we don't want to end up defining our
own &quot;JavaScript-like&quot; language, or negatively impact portability (or
editability) of existing JavaScript code.  Certain tweaks may be
warranted, however, if they simplify the implementation of (and
reflection into) the rest of the system.  Here are some interesting
compiler extensions:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Providing &quot;real&quot; block scope for variables in JavaScript, either by
transforming <tt class="docutils literal">var</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">let</tt> in Mozilla-based browsers, or by creating
new anonymous functions at block level to implement the necessary scoping.</p>
<p>This just simplifies the programming model to better match most
users' expectations.  Very little existing code depends on the <em>lack</em>
of block scope, although naive code written for our Simplified JavaScript
environment might then fail to run in a native JavaScript environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Support <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators">Generators/yield</a> are a powerful language extension, especially when
implementing asynchronous computation.  They are implemented in the
Mozilla JavaScript engines, but not in Webkit or V8.  It would be
helpful to be able to use <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt>, even when running in these
other browsers.</p>
<p>The importance of this feature depends on the details of the event
model we adopt.  Adding <tt class="docutils literal">yield</tt> introduces an incompatibility
with ECMAScript 5 browsers, but not with Mozilla JavaScript
engines.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Allow serialization of (running) program state.</p>
<p>JavaScript currently provides &quot;real&quot; information hiding, in the
form of a function's closure object.  Variables defined in function
scope can be accessed within the function, but not from outside the
scope.  This prevents proper serialization of a created function,
since the scope can not be saved or reconstructed.  Transforming:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
function () {
  var v = ...
}
</pre>
<p>to something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
function($scope) {
  $scope.v = ...
}
</pre>
<p>allows us to manually manage the scope chain, including serializing and
deserializing a function's closure <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2">[1]</a>.  The <tt class="docutils literal">$scope</tt> parameter can be
stored as a <tt class="docutils literal">scope</tt> property of the <tt class="docutils literal">Function</tt> object.</p>
<p>(CSA 2020-02-12: The &quot;frame&quot; object used by <tt class="docutils literal">bcompile.js</tt> is this
<tt class="docutils literal">$scope</tt> object.  But the &quot;local frame&quot; introduced as an
optimization hides local state again.  However, you can treat
<tt class="docutils literal">push_local_frame</tt> as a synonym for <tt class="docutils literal">push_frame</tt> when compiling
to obtain a serializable state, at the expense of performance.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Bind <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> properly in inner functions.</p>
<p>This is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/recommend.html">proposal by Crockford</a>.  Function expressions should
bind <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> from their scope at definition time; only method invocation
should change the <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> binding.  With an explicit scope parameter,
as described above, this can be implemented by defining <tt class="docutils literal">$scope.this</tt> at
function creation time, compiling the <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> literal as
<tt class="docutils literal">(this || $scope.this)</tt>, as implement (non-this-binding) function
invocation as <tt class="docutils literal">f.call(null, <span class="pre">...)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>As with the previous tweak, most existing JavaScript code avoids
use of <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> in inner functions, or manually overrides the
default <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> via a <tt class="docutils literal">bind</tt> utility function.  Existing code is
thus expected to work in our environment, but naive Simplified
JavaScript code will fail to run in a native JavaScript
environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Extend properties of <tt class="docutils literal">Function</tt> objects.</p>
<p>Every function object should have a <tt class="docutils literal">scope</tt> property, as proposed
above, as well as <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">arguments</tt> parameters, as in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/recommend.html">proposal by Crockford</a>.  A <tt class="docutils literal">parsed</tt> property might link to the
Simplified JavaScript parse tree of the function's source.  It
would also be nice to add a means to access the function object
itself from within the function body.  This would allow a function
to access to its own <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">arguments</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">scope</tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal">parsed</tt> properties and any other properties explicitly added to
the <tt class="docutils literal">Function</tt>.  For example, a user framework might add an
<tt class="docutils literal">owner</tt> property to each method defined in a prototype, pointing
at the prototype object itself, in order to allow the function to
access to the prototype chain involved in the function's dispatch.</p>
<p>Most existing code would be unaffected by the presence of additional
properties of Function objects, and most naive user code will not need
to access these properties.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A hidden property mechanism for objects.</p>
<p>For serialization we'll probably want to add a hidden <tt class="docutils literal">$$id</tt> field to
every serializable object; we may wish to add other hidden properties to
support the scope transformation and other needs.  For <tt class="docutils literal">$$id</tt>, it
probably makes the most sense to do this by overriding
<tt class="docutils literal">Object.create()</tt> and ensuring that the new <tt class="docutils literal">$$id</tt> property is
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty">not enumerable</a>.</p>
<p>As an alternative, one might consider adding a &quot;meta object&quot; above
each &quot;real&quot; object in the object's prototype chain.  Properties can
be added to the &quot;meta object&quot; without being enumerable, assuming
that the developer is using the <tt class="docutils literal">hasOwnProperty</tt> <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006072207/http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html">prophylactic</a>.</p>
<p>If a &quot;meta object&quot; mechanism is required, the goal would be to
avoid any changes to the semantics of the language.  This would purely
be an implementation aid for efficient hidden properties.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Environment</h2>
<p>The existing bytecode compiler/interpreter is simple, but it could be
even simpler.  With fewer basic forms, we can get better mileage out
of a small set of powerful optimizations: inlining, constant
propagation, and memoization.  Here's a task list:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Transform all the binary and unary operators into method calls.
They will become simple <tt class="docutils literal">invoke</tt> operations in bytecode.  The tricky
part is just ensuring that method lookup/dispatch works properly on
primitives, and that the various type coercions are done correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remove jumps from the bytecode.  Use dispatch to the boolean
results of comparisons instead.  See the <tt class="docutils literal">ifElse</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>
operators in <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/extensions.html">extensions.js</a>.  An example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
var i = 0;
(function() { i += 1; }).while(this, function() { return i &lt; 5; });

function pluralize(str, n) {
    return str + ((n==1).ifElse(this, function() { return &quot;&quot;; },
                                      function() { return &quot;s&quot;; }));
}
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remove the five <tt class="docutils literal">get_slot</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">set_slot</tt> variants and replace with
<tt class="docutils literal">get_getter</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">get_setter</tt> messages sent to the object's
map.  The <tt class="docutils literal">mapof</tt> operator is the only new bytecode operator
needed.  The result from <tt class="docutils literal">get_getter</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">get_setter</tt> is a
function, so these will be immediately followed by an invocation
to actually perform the get/set.</p>
<p>The implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">get_getter</tt> for a map representing an
array will indirect through the field:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ArrayMap.get_getter = function(field) {
  return field.array_getter(this);
}
</pre>
<p>Then we can make a special &quot;numeric string&quot; subclass of string,
used for strings which can be parsed as <tt class="docutils literal">uint32_t</tt> numbers (ie, valid
array indices) and represented internally as a tagged integer.
(If length &gt; 10 or any of the first 10 characters
is not a digit, then it's not a numeric string.  Negative integers
are not numeric strings.)  This lets us implement array indexing
efficiently as a method of <tt class="docutils literal">NumericString</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
NumericString.array_getter = function(map) {
  // this function creation and its subsequent invocation should
  // be inlined.
  val idx = this.asUint32();
  return native_func(obj) { return memory.get(obj + OFFSET + idx * 8); }
}
// all other fields use normal object lookup.
String.array_getter = function(map) {
  // this should also be inlinable.
  return ObjectMap.get_getter.call(map, this);
}
</pre>
<p>We've now reduced all runtime type tests to the same basic dispatch
mechanism, which we can optimize using specialization and inlining.</p>

<h2>Rendering Ideas</h2>
<p>I originally had two conflicting ideas for rendering the Simplified
JavaScript parse tree:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Move towards a traditional text representation.</p>
<p>Text-based languages are easy to read and understand for a reason:
many years of experience have been used to improve and refine them.
We want to move away from the keyboard and towards a more intuitive
touch-based editing mechanism, but why throw the baby out with the
bathwater?</p>
<p>In this concept, we still use some subtle puzzle-piece styling cues,
but try to fit these &quot;in between the lines&quot;.  The basic layout
should be almost identical to what you'd see in your text editor,
with very good syntax coloring.</p>
<p>Liberal use of the &quot;yada yada yada&quot; operator would be used to
indicate drop points, along with dynamic highlight effects as you
drag over places where an existing construct (block, argument list,
variable declaration, etc) can be extended.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Puzzle pieces.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Turtle_Art">Turtle Art</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823011046/http://education.mit.edu/openblocks">Open Blocks</a> are successful with
kids.  Try to learn from these representations and copy the details
which make them successful.  One key might be switching to more
&quot;open&quot; layouts of block groupings, using a &quot;C&quot; shape open at one
side instead of a box enclosing all the parts.  Similarly, the
space for the test expression in a if or while, or the argument
list in a call, could be left open at the right hand side to allow
the expression/list to grow outside the tile without forcing the
tile itself to expand horizontally.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Current code leaves heavily towards the first option, although we use
puzzle piece styling as much as possible.  The original code used a
&quot;stacking&quot; 3d look which made deeply-nested expressions look too
&quot;tall&quot;; the current look using a single 3d level, with pieces fitting
into indents so that the combination of pieces is still flat.</p>
<p>Additional thoughts:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Repeated binary expressions (<tt class="docutils literal">... + ... + ...</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">... &amp;&amp; ... &amp;&amp;
...</tt>) need to be flattened, instead of exposing the parse tree
details.  Explicit piece boundaries should only be shown where
precedence levels vary, where they serve to visually indicate
&quot;parentheses&quot; in the traditional text representation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It may be possible to aggressively use a &quot;click to expand&quot;
representation, so that the rendering of a long function or namespace
is not overwhelmingly complex.  Initially we might only see a list of
top level symbols, with expander boxes.  Clicking on the expander
would show the definition of that symbol.  (This could visually relate
to the way the object browser represents non-primitive field values:
in both cases an &quot;expander&quot; would be used to show/edit a complex
value.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I believe we want to explicitly represent &quot;line breaks&quot;, rather than
allow constructs to extend indefinitely to the right.  My original
thought was to just add a &quot;new line&quot; flag to the <tt class="docutils literal">binop</tt> node and
to the function call nodes (both the &quot;binary&quot; and &quot;ternary&quot; forms).
Setting the newline flag on the <tt class="docutils literal">binop</tt> would arrange the &quot;right&quot;
and &quot;left&quot; operands vertically.  Setting the newline flag on the
function invocation would arrange the arguments vertically.
Similar flags would allow you to toggle vertical/horizontal
orientations for the arguments of function definitions, and for the
array and object constructor forms.</p>
<p>My current thinking is that all tokens should have a
&quot;newlinesAfter&quot; count, and as many places as possible should
support adding newlines to the rendering, using a uniform gesture.</p>
<p>An alternative is to make layout &quot;smarter&quot; so that the correct
orientation is selected automatically.  It's probably possible to
reach a happy medium in which automatic line breaks happen in
reasonable places but the user is still able to customize the
display for additional clarity/expressiveness.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I'd prefer that syntactic extension to the base language occur
through the definition of new <em>graphical block</em> types, which can
desugar to the basic AST structures; thus, the block widget is a type of
macro.  We still need a means to represent the macro textually, so
that there is a lossless conversion between text and graphical
forms, but correspondence might be accomplished by simple
convention, like being imported from a path rooted at <tt class="docutils literal">macros</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
var ForBlockMacro = imports.macros.ForBlockMacro;
var foo = function() {
     var i;
     ForBlockMacro(function() { i=0; },
                   function() { return i &lt; 5; },
                   function() { i+=1; },
                   function() { /* body */ });
}
</pre>
<p>A user without a definition for <tt class="docutils literal">ForBlockMacro</tt> would see
a graphical representation corresponding to the text above.  But if the
<tt class="docutils literal">ForBlockMacro</tt> function includes an <tt class="docutils literal">asWidget()</tt> method, it could
define its own graphical representation which could suppress the
<tt class="docutils literal">function()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> cruft to yield a graphical representation
identical to the traditional syntactic form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for ( i=0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i+=1 ) {
  /* body */
}
</pre>
<p>But this resemblance is purely visual; the underlying source
language and syntax remains unchanged.  More radical visual changes
could also be accomplished, but display of macros can also be
toggled off to yield more traditional (if verbose) syntax.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renderer-tasks">
<h2>Renderer Tasks</h2>
<p>The following is a potential implementation order for additional
rendering tasks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Split <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/crender.html">crender.js</a> to separate out the Widget definitions from the
code which transforms a parse tree into widgets.  Perhaps make
the AST node definitions their own separate module as well, instead
of conflating them with token objects in <a class="reference external" href="http://turtlescript.github.cscott.net/docco/parse.html">parse.js</a>?</li>
<li>Move parenthesization of expressions based on precedence from the
transform code into the widget rendering.  Parentheses should
automatically appear around a binop if its operator precedence is
lower than its context.</li>
<li>Add the ability to losslessly render Widgets back into Simplified JavaScript
source and/or a parse tree.</li>
<li>Add basic 'pick' functionality.  (Possibly split Widget
representation into Composite/Composable at the same time, as is
done in <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420073152/http://piumarta.com/software/cola/canvas.pdf">Lessphic</a>.)</li>
<li>Allow dragging widgets (but not actual editing yet).</li>
<li>Allow editing trees via drag and drop (but not yet editing/creating
names).</li>
<li>Click to edit literals, including name literals.  (Modal dialog is
fine at first.)</li>
<li>Name literal browser/palettes, for each access to all the names
that are in scope.  Perhaps combine this with an object browser
which can display active objects and let you drag/drop slot names.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interaction-ideas">
<h2>Interaction Ideas</h2>
<p>I hope that TurtleScript will be used to explore interaction models for
programming on touchscreen devices.  Here are some of my current ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Managing flicker (avoiding resize).</p>
<p>Dragging pieces into a dynamically-resizing rendering causes
excessive flicker as the various drop targets expand/contract.  The
flicker may cause the drop target itself to move, which may make it
impossible to drop the piece in a desired location.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the drop targets should be identified
<em>without</em> resizing the rendering; any expansion should occur only
<em>after</em> the drop.  For example, border colors might highlight to
indicate that a drop may occur between two existing tiles.  When
you drag a block out, it should be replaced by a &quot;yada yada yada&quot;
element <em>of the exact same size</em> so that the parent widget does
not immediately change.  Only after the drop should the yada yada
yada shrink.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could explore an &quot;explicit resize&quot; model, where
the user uses an explicit pinch/spread gesture to expand or
contract an element (block body, say).  This gives more control of
layout to the user, at the cost of forcing them to perform
additional actions to &quot;tidy up&quot; the display.  Perhaps &quot;double tap
to shrink fit&quot; is the main gesture -- after you drag out a large
block body, the placeholder yada yada yada stays the same large
size until you double tap it.  The benefit is entirely avoiding
automatic resize (and thus flicker) during editing.</p>
<p>Some additional study of existing block-based systems is warranted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Clone by default.</p>
<p>It's more common to copy (and then modify) a part than to reorder
the parts of a program.  The default behavior when dragging a piece
which is currently part of some structure (not free floating on the
workspace) should be to drag a clone.  A separate double-tap or
swipe gesture should be used to delete the original, if a move was
actually desired.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Tap to break apart.</p>
<p>It's visually confusing to show all the possible drop targets or
subcomponents for every expression and statement.  Introducing a
uniform &quot;tap to break apart&quot; gesture would allow hiding these
details unless/until they are necessary.  Each tap would reveal the
boundaries in one additional level of structure (the individual
statements in a function, for instance).  Additional taps on a
subcomponent would allow drilling down to additional levels of
detail (exposing the parts of an assignment statement, for instance).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Pervasive &quot;undo&quot;.</p>
<p>Each change to a program should be easily reversible.  Similarly,
editing the state of a live object should also be reversible: it
should be possible to go &quot;back in time&quot; before the execution of a
function or assignment of a field.  (Clearing the turtle's
drawing canvas might even use this mechanism.)</p>
<p>In practice this is probably implemented by serializing
logarithmically-spaced program states and recording mutations and
executions.  We can then revert to the state at a previous time by
deserializing an appropriate older state and then replaying all
interactive mutations/function executions which occurred between
that state and the desired point in time.  This is the approach
used by recent work, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.88.2071">Jockey</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.130.6878">Flashback</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/papers/USENIX-95W.html">libckpt</a>,
and results in time travel time complexity proportional to the
distance traveled.</p>

<li><p class="first">Building on the shoulders of HTML/CSS/DOM/JavaScript (or not)</p>
<p>One original goal was to attempt to leverage the existing HTML
elements and DOM rather than invent our own GUI framework.
We'd use DOM event model (with some
sugar).  Applications should serialize to an HTML/CSS tree with
JavaScript bindings; probably other bits like &quot;the current contents
of a canvas&quot; could be serialized as well.  Perhaps CSS and the DOM
can be unified with JavaScript/JSON using something like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.featureblend.com/css-json.html">CSS
JSON</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://jsonml.org/DOM/">JsonML</a> to mitigate the number of different syntaxes
involved.</p>
<p>At the moment, I feel that the complexity this adds to the
environment isn't warranted.  We should be able to harness/embed
HTML/CSS, but we shouldn't use it as a building block.  Perhaps
some &quot;Simplified HTML&quot; subset can be employed.  As a limit case,
perhaps only &lt;canvas&gt; elements?  (That's what we're doing now.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Work on serialization format.</p>
<p>First step towards a serializable environment is to write a simple
module loader.  Assuming we've written a module (JavaScript plus
its visible DOM tree and event bindings) to disk, what does it look
like?  How do we re-load it?  For speed we want to leverage the
existing native HTML, JavaScript and JSON parsers in the browser.
Four possible solutions (perhaps there are others):</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">The module is an HTML file loaded via &lt;iframe&gt; injection.</p>
<p>This is probably the preferred approach.  We use the native
HTML and JavaScript parsers, and can (<a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823033030/http://cananian.livejournal.com/60624.html">in some browsers</a>) reparent
the iframe in order to pull pieces of the environment out into
their own windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The module is a JavaScript source file, loaded via &lt;script&gt; injection.</p>
<p>In this case all the HTML/DOM content needs to be
generated programmatically by JavaScript code or <a class="reference external" href="http://jsonml.org/DOM/">JsonML</a>.  This
might be slower than direct HTML parsing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The module is a JSON object, loaded via AJAX or from browser-local
storage, and post-processed.</p>
<p>JSON (with an appropriate prefix, or <a class="reference external" href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">JSON-P</a>) could be directly loaded
via &lt;script&gt; as well as parsed from a string using the (fast) native JSON
parser <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id6">[2]</a>.  We'd need to post-process the JSON to handle cycles and
functions, and programmatically recreate the DOM as in the previous
option <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id7">[4]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Direct implementation of <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821113753/http://json.org/module.html">Crockford's &lt;module&gt; proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Might be tricky to do without native browser support.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Build an in-browser VM.</p>
<p>My most recent work has been inspired by efforts like <a class="reference external" href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/index.html">jslinux</a>
which use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/">JavaScript Typed Array</a> API to build &quot;low level&quot;
abstractions in the browser.  I believe it's possible to
construct a reasonably-performing object model in the browser
using a raw memory abstraction.  This then trivially allows for
serialization.  The major disadvantage is that we lose
interoperability with native browser objects, and potentially
a bit of the performance of the native VM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Picking a serialization format and building it should foreground
representation and project-scope issues.  At the end we'll have a
hand-built module as well as a lightweight module loader.</p>
<p>Once we have a serialized module, how do we save a module as a
complete application (presumably, including all of its
dependencies)?  This probably entails a somewhat heavier &quot;app
loader&quot; framework, which can take a given module as an argument.
The loader should be able to pull in the full compiler, object
browser, etc as needed (but maybe on-demand rather than up front).
It would be nice to be able to construct a module in an &quot;IDE&quot;
environment, or by modifying an existing sample or app, and then
&quot;save as&quot; to make the new module a first-class standalone app.</p>
